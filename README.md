# uYouCompat

uYou compatibility tweak for iOS < 13, created with permission from the author of uYou.

Due to uYou requires iOS 13 or higher, I think that iOS 11 - 12 users should still be able to use uYou without crashing because of iOS 13+ APIs. uYouCompat adds such missing APIs to make uYou functions fine. uYouCompat targets uYou 1.5 and lower.
